## Technical Considerations & Best Practices

### Notification System Options for GCP:

1. **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** - Recommended
   - ✅ Native GCP integration
   - ✅ Cross-platform support (web, mobile)
   - ✅ Free tier with generous limits
   - ✅ Rich notification features

2. **GCP Pub/Sub + Custom Delivery**
   - ✅ High scalability and reliability
   - ✅ Event-driven architecture
   - ❌ Requires custom notification delivery
   - ✅ Good for internal system notifications

3. **Third-party Services (Pusher, Ably)**
   - ✅ Easy integration
   - ❌ Additional cost
   - ❌ External dependency

**Recommendation**: Use FCM for push notifications + GCP Pub/Sub for internal event handling

### Development Best Practices

- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky for consistent code
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration
- **Testing**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Documentation**: Inline code docs and API documentation
- **Security**: Regular dependency updates and security audits
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, image optimization, caching strategies
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Mobile**: Touch targets ≥44px, responsive breakpoints

### Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1-3**: 3-4 weeks (Infrastructure & Auth)
- **Phase 4-6**: 4-5 weeks (Core Features)
- **Phase 7-8**: 5-6 weeks (Gamification & Frontend)
- **Phase 9-11**: 3-4 weeks (Real-time, Testing, Security)
- **Phase 12-13**: 2-3 weeks (Deployment & Launch)

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 17-22 weeks for complete implementation

### Next Steps

1. Review and approve this implementation plan
2. Set up the development environment
3. Begin with Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure
4. Establish regular sprint cycles (2-week sprints recommended)
5. Set up project management tools (Jira, GitHub Projects, etc.)
