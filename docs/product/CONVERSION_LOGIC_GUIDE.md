# So build me a full flow for a product that allows parents to assign tasks to children so that children will get more gaming time or meeting with friends or spending money by doing their chores such as home work, cleaning their room, helping their younger siblings, etc'

Here is a full end-to-end flow for a product enabling parents to assign chores to children so kids can unlock gaming time, social outings, or spending money by completing tasks like homework, cleaning, or helping siblings.[^1][^2][^3]

### Parent Setup \& Assignment

- Parents create individual child profiles.
- Parents set a list of chores (homework, cleaning room, caregiving, etc.), each with frequency, difficulty, and value.[^2][^4][^1]
- Parents attach a specific reward to each chore or allow children to accumulate points that can later be redeemed for their choice of reward (gaming time, meeting friends, allowance).[^3][^1][^2]
- Optionally, parents set family values or expectations (e.g., kindness, teamwork) with bonus points for behaviors aligned with these values.[^1][^2]


### Child Experience \& Motivators

- Children receive notifications or see a daily dashboard listing assigned chores, their point values, and available rewards.[^4][^1]
- Each child can select which tasks to focus on or accept challenges for bonus points (giving autonomy).[^4][^1]
- Completing chores grants instant feedback—points, badges, avatars, and progression bars.[^3][^1]
- Regular streaks and mini-competitions between siblings or with parents can be enabled for extra engagement.[^2][^1]
- Rewards include choices like unlocking extra game time, scheduling a playdate, spending their earned allowance, or special experiences (movie night, choosing dinner).[^1][^3]


### Reward Redemption

- Points are converted into predetermined rewards through the app—children can request to redeem play time, outings, or money; parents approve and the system logs usage for fairness and transparency.[^5][^1]
- Achievements and redeemed rewards are celebrated within the app interface (animations, sound effects)—children see visible evidence of their effort-to-reward ratio.[^3][^1]


### Ongoing Engagement \& Family Feedback

- Calendar and progress dashboard available for parents to track task completion, reward redemption, and overall engagement levels.[^4][^1]
- Dynamic rules: parents can update chore lists, adjust conversion rates, and introduce limited-time challenges or seasonal bonuses.[^1][^4]
- Family communication tools within the app allow parents to praise, or collaboratively set new goals as habits improve.[^2][^1]
